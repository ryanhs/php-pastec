pastec "implementation" in PHP, a test project

this project actually for my final project in "design interaction" subject ITB Indonesia
i made a little project that can recognize object in an image..

but in this case, a realtime image recognizer.

there is 3 important files:
- index.php 
	a web interface for camera, point your camera to somewhere and see the index.php
- admin.php
	for manage image sample, not even a login here haha, just for demo project
- show.php
	a video player when object recognized
 


#### still early development, i just create this project.. << will remove this label when finished


## installation
pretty easy, just use `bower`
